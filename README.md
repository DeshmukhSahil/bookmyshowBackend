* Data Storage and Retrieval: The backend is responsible for interacting with the database (in this case, MongoDB) to store and retrieve data. It handles tasks such as creating, reading, updating, and deleting data.

* API Endpoints: The backend exposes a set of API endpoints that the client-side can communicate with. These endpoints define the various operations that can be performed on the data and allow the client-side to request and send data to the server.

* Error Handling and Logging: The backend handles error handling and logging to identify and capture any issues that occur during server-side operations. It provides meaningful error messages and logs to help with debugging and troubleshooting.
